# Custom features

The funding that supports the VBL allows us to support the development of Pinpoint, Urchin, and Glue as well as long-term maintenance. We also set aside time to develop custom features for users.

The first ten hours of requests that your lab makes will be added to our regular development queue at no cost. 

After using those hours, we can either develop features for you as collaborators on your projects or through a contract model. We are also happy to apply for joint grants as contractors, collaborators, or co-PIs.

## Contract model

Additional development time, or prioritized development of features, can be requested at a contractor rate of $100/hr, by sending us an email with details or by opening an issue on Github with the `contract` label. Some examples of requests and billable hour estimates:

 - Building a custom probe model in Pinpoint (1-2 hours)
 - Remote installation and debugging of the Electrophysiology Link package (2-5 hours)
 - Developing a new interactive visualization of a large-scale dataset (5-10 hours)
 - Developing a new 3D experimental paradigm (10+ hours)
