# Trial Viewer

As part of the International Brain Laboratory's [public data website](https://viz.internationalbrainlab.org) we created two interactive 3D tools. You can see them in action on the site!

## Mini Brain

The Mini Brain is a widget that lets you select different probe insertions from the Brain Wide Map and explore the alignment of the insertion within the 3D mouse brain.

## Trial Viewer

The Trial Viewer is an interactive component that lets you re-play the metadata recorded during a session, including the stimulus position, wheel movements, sounds, and the videos. These are rendered in a cartoon 3D environment with the deeplabcut output overlayed on the videos.
