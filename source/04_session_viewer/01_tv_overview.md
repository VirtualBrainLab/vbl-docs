# Trial Viewer

As part of the International Brain Laboratory's [public data website](https://viz.internationalbrainlab.org) we created two interactive 3D tools. You can see them in action on the site!

## Mini Brain

The Mini Brain is a widget that lets you select different probe insertions from the Brain Wide Map and explore the alignment of the insertion within the 3D mouse brain.

The Trial Viewer is an interactive component that lets you re-play the metadata recorded during a session, including the stimulus position, wheel movements, sounds, and the videos. These are rendered in a cartoon 3D environment with the deeplabcut output overlayed on the videos.
