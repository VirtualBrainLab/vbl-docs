# Sensapex Link

Pinpoint can be connected to Sensapex manipulators so that you can observe live where your probe is in inside of the mouse brain as well as control manipulators from Pinpoint. To enable this feature you need to set up and enable the Ephys Link server, details can be found here (todo). 

## Connecting to a server

1. Press [H] to open the settings menu
2. Switch to the "Sensapex Link" tab
3. Fill in the server's IP address and port number
4. Click connect. Upon success, the connect button will read "disconnect"
5. Press [H] again to close the settings menu

## Linking a probe in the planner to a manipulator in real life

2. Press [H] to open the settings menu
3. Switch to the "Sensapex Link" tab
4. Using the dropdown for each probe, select the desired manipulator to connect to
