# Electrophysiology Atlas

When inserting electrodes there is some uncertainty about what depth you've reached and what brain areas you are in, even with the best trajectory planning software available. Our goal with the Electrophysiology Atlas feature in Pinpoint is to improve your ability to target brain areas by providing tools to help you identify what brain area you are recording from live. The first tool we are making available is a predicted electrophysiology tool.
