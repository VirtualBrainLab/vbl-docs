Virtual Brain Lab
==================

The VBL builds intuitive and interactive 3D visualizations for neuroscience.

We are located within the `Steinmetz Lab <http://steinmetzlab.net>`_ at the University of Washington and many of our projects are collaborations with the `International Brain Laboratory <https://www.internationalbrainlab.com>`_.

Please see the individual projects for installation instructions and documentation. You can find all our code on `Github <https://github.com/VirtualBrainLab>`_.
