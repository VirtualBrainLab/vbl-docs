## Install

The easiest way to use Pinpoint is through our [web app](https://data.virtualbrainlab.org/Pinpoint/).

### Standalone builds

Our recommended source for the latest Windows and Linux Desktop builds is through [Pinpoint on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2434260/Pinpoint/), downloading via Steam ensures your client will always stay up to date.

You can also find minor releases on the [releases page](https://github.com/VirtualBrainLab/Pinpoint/releases)

<!-- ### Additional linux instructions

To run the linux executable you need to go to the unzipped folder and run `chmod +x` on the .x86_64 file. Some users may run into permissions issues, in which case running ` chown -R yourusername .` from within the folder should repair those. -->

<!-- ### Additional mac instructions

The mac executable currently only runs on MacOS **Mojave** and earlier. You will probably have a security issue because the app is unsigned. Go to Systems Preferences > Security & Privacy > General and allow the file to "run anyway".  -->

## Instructions

Please see the [tutorials](https://virtualbrainlab.org/pinpoint/tutorial.html) pages for instructions.

## Troubleshooting

The most common cause of Pinpoint not loading is that your browser is blocking the data from downloading. Disabling plugins that interfere with javascript often resolves these issues (e.g. ad blocking plugins).

If you encounter issues after an update, you may need to clear your browser's cache or download the latest release.

## Bugs

Please report issues on the [issues page](https://github.com/VirtualBrainLab/Pinpoint/issues).

## Citing

A preprint describing Pinpoint has been [published on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.14.548952). The paper provides an introduction to the key features and it can be used as a citation if Pinpoint proves integral to a scientific publication.
