Please contact Dan (dbirman@uw.edu) if you are interested in contributing to the Virtual Brain Lab.

Academia has systematically excluded Black, Indigenous, and people of color and the fields of systems and computational neuroscience further exclude women and intersectional identities. The Virtual Brain Lab project is committed to making neuroscience a more open and inclusive field.

## Undergraduate research positions at UW

Are you motivated by the idea of building software for scientists? If you have some experience creating an independent software program (e.g. a hackathon or side project) and you are comfortable in either Python or Java/C# you may be a good fit for our projects!

Joining the VBL as a student developer is an opportunity to build applied technology while developing your skills as a programmer. Because we are part of a cutting-edge neuroscience laboratory at UW you will learn a lot of neuroscience along the way.

## Software devs / Researchers

The VBL does not have independent funding to pay researchers (graduate students, postdocs, or software engineers). If you have your own funding or you are interested in working together to apply for funding please get in touch.

## Volunteers

All VBL software is released open-source. You are welcome to make a pull request to any repository with your contributions.
