# Join Us

Are you motivated by the idea of building software for scientists? We're making interactive 3D visualization possible for research. In practice, that means working with large-scale datasets and doing data wrangling as well as building user-facing tools, often with the Unity game engine. 

Embedded in the Virtual Brain Lab project is the idea that science should be more accessible and we are committed to empowering a diverse group of neuroscientists. We strongly encourage applications from underrepresented groups and backgrounds. All applicants with innovative ideas are encouraged to apply.

Contact Dan Birman with inquiries/questions (dbirman@uw.edu).

## Undergraduate research at UW

Joining the VBL as a student is an opportunity to build applied technology while developing your skills as a programmer. As a member of a cutting-edge neuroscience laboratory at UW you will also learn a lot of neuroscience along the way. We pay all undergraduate researchers who join the lab. Beacuse of this, there are limited spaces available. Reach out to Dan if you are interested. 

## Software devs / Researchers

The VBL does not have independent funding to pay researchers (graduate students, postdocs, or software engineers). If you have your own funding or you are interested in working together to apply for funding please get in touch.

If you are interested in volunteering your time to develop new features please get in touch with Dan. Note that Unity has a steep learning curve, expect to invest a substantial amount of time just learning to use the tool.

All VBL software is released open-source under either an MIT or GPLv3 license. You are welcome to make a pull request to any repository with your contributions.
