# Overview

The VBL builds intuitive and interactive 3D visualizations for neuroscience.

We are located within the [Steinmetz Lab](http://steinmetzlab.net) at the University of Washington and many of our projects are collaborations with the [International Brain Laboratory](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com).

Please see the individual projects for installation instructions and documentation. You can find all our code on [Github](https://github.com/VirtualBrainLab).

## Funding

The VBL is funded indirectly by generous grants from the Washington Research Foundation, National Science Foundation, Simons Collaboration for the Global Brain, and the Wellcome Trust.
