Virtual Brain Lab
=============================================

We build intuitive and interactive 3D visualizations for neuroscience data.

The VBL is located within the `Steinmetz Lab <http://steinmetzlab.net>`_ at the University of Washington and many of our projects are collaborations with the `International Brain Laboratory <https://www.internationalbrainlab.com>`_.

Please see the individual projects for installation instructions and documentation!
