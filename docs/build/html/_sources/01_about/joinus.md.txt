# Join Us

Please contact Dan (dbirman@uw.edu) if you think working on the Virtual Brain Lab projects might be a good fit for you. We welcome all inquiries! Academia has systematically excluded Black, Indigenous, and people of color and the fields of systems and computational neuroscience further exclude women and intersectional identities. The Virtual Brain Lab project is committed to making neuroscience a more open and inclusive field.

## Undergraduate research positions

Are you motivated by the idea of building software for scientists? If you have some experience creating an independent software program (e.g. a hackathon or side project) and you are comfortable in either Python or Java/C# you may be a good fit for our projects!

Joining the Virtual Brain Lab as a student developer is an opportunity to build applied technology while developing your skills as a programmer. Because we are part of a cutting-edge neuroscience laboratory at UW you will learn a lot of neuroscience along the way.

## Software devs / Researchers

We don't currently have any independent funding to pay researchers (graduate students, postdocs, or software engineers). If you have your own funding and are interested in working with us email Dan.

## Volunteers

The Virtual Brain Lab is an open-source software project and we appreciate any contributions from volunteers. Get in touch and lets find a place for you!
