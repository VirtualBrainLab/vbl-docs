# Neuropixels Trajectory Planner

This is a tool for planning Neuropixels recordings with up to sixteen 1.0, 2.0, or up to four 4-shank 2.0 probes.

## Known issues

### CCF -> in vivo issues

The CCF coordinates returned by this tool are not identical to the in vivo mouse brain. We know for sure that the CCF atlas is stretched along the DV axis (in vivo = 0.952 * CCF) and squashed on the AP axis (in vivo 1.087 * CCF). You can use the **Stereotaxic coordinates** setting to output coordinates that have been corrected for these differences. Note that there also appears to be a rotation in the lamda-bregma angle of about 5 degrees, we are not yet accounting for this.

## Install

The easiest way to use the trajectory planner is through our web app: http://data.virtualbrainlab.org/NPTrajectoryPlanner/. If you encounter issues please try refreshing the page (sometimes the 3D mesh files don't download on the first load). If that fails, disable any plugins that might be interfering with javascript (e.g. ad blockers).

### Standalone builds

You can also download a Desktop build from the ![releases page](https://github.com/dbirman/NPTrajectoryPlanner/releases). We can build for linux on request.

<!-- ### Additional linux instructions

To run the linux executable you need to go to the unzipped folder and run `chmod +x` on the .x86_64 file. Some users may run into permissions issues, in which case running ` chown -R yourusername .` from within the folder should repair those. -->

<!-- ### Additional mac instructions

The mac executable currently only runs on MacOS **Mojave** and earlier. You will probably have a security issue because the app is unsigned. Go to Systems Preferences > Security & Privacy > General and allow the file to "run anyway".  -->

## Instructions for use

To set up a new probe, select the button in the bottom right corresponding to the probe type (NP1/NP2/NP2.4). By default the probe's (0,0,0) coordinate is set to the IBL bregma coordinate (CCF: AP 5.4f, ML 5.739f, DV 0.332f).

At any time you can press [M] to open the manual coordinate entry window and enter coordinates directly. 

### Controls

The easiest way to control your probe is to click on the probe, press one of the axis keys [W/S], [A/D], or [Z/X] and then drag. This will move the probe along the corresponding axis. You can also press any of the keyboard keys in the diagram below to move along that axis. Hold **SHIFT** as you to move faster along any axis. Hold **CTRL** to move slower. Pressing and holding a key will move continuously.

![probe controls](https://github.com/dbirman/NPTrajectoryPlanner/raw/main/Images/ProbeControls.png)

Use [W/A/S/D] to move the probe along the AP or ML axis.

Azimuth is the angle of the probe manipulator relative to the brain. Use [Q/E] to control azimuth.

Elevation is the angle of the probe on the manipulator, and is restricted to the range 0 (vertical) to 90 (horizontal). Use [R/F] to control elevation.

Use [Z/X] to insert the probe.

Note that the rotation point is the insertion coordinate with depth==0 (i.e. the point the tip was at before you inserted the probe). I'll change this in a future release, but for now if you rotate the probe after inserting it will rotate around that insertion point.

Use [1/3] to spin the probe along the axis of the probe shank. Note that NP2.4 probes spin around the rightmost probe shank when looking towards the side with the electrodes.

Probes can be deleted with [Backspace]. To recover a probe you didn't mean to delete press [CTRL + Backspace].

### Recording region

Once the probe is at the position and angles you want, you can adjust the recording region size (in the settings) and position (using [T/G]) to match what you plan to do in your recording and adjust the insertion depth accordingly.

### Export coordinates

Clicking on the coordinates shown at the bottom of the screen copies them to the clipboard. If the azimuth angle is not at 0/90/180 use the "convert AP/ML to probe axis" setting to export the position along the probe forward/side axis.

### Changing the active probe

When setting up multi-probe insertions you can click the probe panel, the probe model, or the probe coordinate text to set that probe to active. 

## Using coordinates for surgery

To use your coordinates for a surgery, rotate the manipulator to match the azimuth angle and set the probe elevation angle. Then move your probe tip to Bregma and zero your manipulator.

To translate the probe you can either use the AP/ML coordinates (if you kept the azimuth angle at a multiple of 90 degrees) or you can turn on the "Convert AP/ML to probe axis" setting, which exports the translation coordinates in the probe's forward and side axes.

To insert the probe, drive the probe forward until the tip touches the brain, zero the depth axis, and continue forward at a slow speed until you reach the specified depth.

In a future release we will add a display of the expected channel activity for a live recording, to help ensure accurate targeting. Coming soon!

## Saving and loading probes

You can save the coordinates of an insertion for future use by clicking on the coordinate text. This copies the active probe coordinates to a string.

## Settings

**Reset active probe** - Returns the active probe to the original starting position (Bregma by default)

**Spawn IBL probes** - Places two NP1.0 probes in the configuration used by the IBL

**Detect collisions** - Warns the user when two probes are colliding on their shank or on their probe holders

**Set (0,0,0) to Bregma** - On: sets the 0,0,0 coordinate to Bregma, or to the 0,0,0 CCF coordinate when unchecked (default: on)

**Depth from brain surface** - On: measures insertion depth from the brain surface, Off: from the DV=0 plane (default: on)

**Sagittal/Coronal slices** - Dropdown menu allows you to choose different volumes to slice. The annotation dataset is the most useful for trajectory planning.

**Display area acronyms** - On: show only acronyms for brain areas (default: off)

**Areas include layers** - On: include the layers (e.g. in cortex) (default: on)

**Rig** - Dropdown with options for rigs to display

**Recording region only** - On: display only the areas within the recording region, Off: show the areas along the whole probe shank (default: on)

**Recording region size** - Slider controls the size of the recording region. Defaults to a set of options that depend on the probe.

**Display In-Plane Slice** - On: shows a slice of cortex that is "in-plane" with the probe, note that this uses a camera that is looking at the probe from the "front", i.e. towards the electrodes (default: on)

**Convert AP/ML to probe** - On: when the probe manipulator is off of the 0/90 axis the AP/ML positions are not useful for calculating the insertion point relative to Bregma with a regular manipulator, turn this on to display the position along the probe forward/side axes (default: off)

**Use stereotaxic coordinates** - On: displays the **s**tereo**t**axic stAP, stML, and stDV coordinates instead of the CCF space coordinates. (default: off)

**Craniotomy** - On: opens a window that allows the user to control the skull craniotomy window, use with the Rig: Skull dropdown option (default: off)

**IBL map** - On: displays a sphere at the location of each remaining second pass map location, clicking on a sphere moves the active probe controller to that location. You must set the depth value by hand (click probe, press [Z/X], then drag down; or just press [Z/X])
